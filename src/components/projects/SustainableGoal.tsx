                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of
                  17 interlinked global goals designed to be a &quot;shared

                  These goals were set up in 2015 by the United Nations General
                  Assembly and are intended to be achieved by 2030. They address
                  global challenges including poverty, inequality, climate
                  change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.

                  will involve tackling issues more commonly associated with
                  another. They balance the three dimensions of sustainable
                  development: economic, social, and environmental.

                  The SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty,
                  protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of
                  everyone, everywhere. All 193 UN Member States have committed
                  to these goals, recognizing that ending poverty must go
                  hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and
                  address a range of social needs including education, health,
                  social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling
                  climate change and environmental protection.

                  The principle of &quot;leaving no one behind&quot; is at the

                  targets are met for all nations, peoples, and segments of
                  society, reaching those furthest behind first. This principle
                  reflects the Agenda&apos;s central focus on equity, inclusion,
                  and the promise to eradicate poverty in all its forms.
