                    They address global challenges including poverty,
                    inequality, climate change, environmental degradation,
                    peace, and justice.

                    environmental.

                    The SDGs are a universal call to action to end poverty,

                    everyone, everywhere. All 193 UN Member States have
                    committed to these goals, recognizing that ending poverty
                    must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic
                    growth and address a range of social needs including
                    education, health, social protection, and job opportunities,
                    while tackling climate change and environmental protection.
